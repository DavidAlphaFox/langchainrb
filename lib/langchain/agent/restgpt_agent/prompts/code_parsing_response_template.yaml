  Here is an API response JSON snippet with its corresponding schema and a query. 
  The API's response JSON follows the schema.
  Assume the JSON response is stored in a Ruby hash variable called 'data', your task is to generate Ruby code to extract information I need from the API response.
  Please print the final result.
  The example result format are:
  "The release date of the album is 2002-11-03"
  "The id of the person is 12345"
  Note you should generate only Ruby code.
  DO NOT use fields that are not in the response schema.
  DO NOT use "list comprehensions" in your generated code.
